It looks like you are facing a conflict with Git. To resolve this, you can specify how to handle divergent branches by running one of the following commands, depending on how you want to resolve the merge:

1. **Merge the changes** (default):
   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase false
   ```

2. **Rebase the changes**:
   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase true
   ```

3. **Fast-forward only** (if possible):
   ```bash
   git config pull.ff only
   ```

If you want to apply the configuration globally (for all repositories), add `--global` to the command:
```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false  # Example for merging globally
``` 

Once you have done this, you can pull the changes again using:
```bash
git pull
```

This will resolve the conflict based on the method you've selected.
